# LOCATING THE MALLS NEAR ME
You can easily track my daily schedule or moves, one of the things in the loop is visiting the mall. I
came into Iowa State just about a month ago, one of the few things I wanted to check out or know
about is where the credible malls to get necessities are located. My flat mate introduced me to
Walmart, it is pretty far, my thought was that, it is the only credible mall here. Later on, I realized
there are host of other malls. That may be a good thing to dive into for this case study, knowing all
the malls near me. So I used the API from the google earth and used that to extract the malls
within a particular radius near me.
